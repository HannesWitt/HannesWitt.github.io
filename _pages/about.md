I am a chemist working in (super-)molecular biophysics in the group of [Gijs Wuite](https://www.gijswuite.com/) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. In my research, I want to understand how meso-/macroscopic properties of organelles, cells or tissues emerge from molecular interactions. This emergence of function from molecular processes is a universal feature of living systems and can be found everywhere in living cells. My current focus is to understand the mechanics and organization of mitotic chromosomes. In the past, I also worked on the mechanics of intermediate filaments, cell mechanics and dynamics of lipid bilayers. For my research, I apply different biophysical techniques with a particular focus on atomic force microscopy and optical tweezers. If you want to learn more about my research, check out my publications and do not hesitate to reach out to me.
 
##### Short course of my scientific life:
I studied chemistry in Göttingen, Odense and Bremen. Afterwards, I got my PhD under supervision of [Andreas Janshoff](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/208570.html) in Göttingen (funded by DFG via GGNB excellence stipend). After postdoctoral work with [Claudia Steinem](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/213067.html) in Göttingen I moved to Amsterdam to work as a postdoc in the group of Gijs Wuite (funded by DGF).
